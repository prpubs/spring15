Howdy! I'm glad you've made it to the course content area for PR Pubs. You'll see a unit for each week of the course similar to this one. In short, each week you will have some course content as well as assignments that you complete (more below on how that is graded). This week is slightly different as we are just easing into the course, so we are going to be spending the week prepping for the rest of the semester by building our toolkit. One thing to know, there is a LOT of things we want to get started this week. With that, things I want you to do:

# Assignments for Orientation Week

## 1\. Read the [syllabus][syllabus]

This will be helpful in getting a broad sense of what we will be doing throughout the course. My hope is that it serves as a roadmap for 1.) what will happen and 2.) how you can be successful.

## 2\. Build your domain / blog

For this class you are required to maintain a domain andblog, which will become a portfolio by the end of the semester. You may already have a blog (great!) and it's absolutely okay to use that, but my strong recommendation would be getting an actual domain (.com, .org, .net) if you don't have that already. You'll see attached to this page a video on how to setup Wordpress on a domain via http://create.ou.edu, a service which is provided to you as student at the University of Oklahoma. Wordpress is a free, highly popular, open source blogging platform. You can also use a commercial host such as [Reclaim Hosting](http://reclaimhosting.com) or [Lithium Hosting](http://lithiumhosting.com). Below are two videos. One walks your through how to sign up with OU Create and the other shows you how to install Wordpress. Take about half an hour and complete these tutorials. You can also read more on Wordpress on the [OU Create support documentation page](http://create.ou.edu/support/applications/wordpress).

## 3\. Submit your domain address

## 4\. Write your first post

This activity is designed so that you have a creative way of introducing yourself to the rest of class as well as begin to understand how your blog technically functions. You are asked to write a post describing your favorite spot on campus and its significance in your life. For example, this could be your favorite study spot, the place of a fond memory, your seat in your favorite class, etc. You are required to have at least **one picture** of this place in your post and it's preferable that you take it yourself. Taking this with your smartphone or any camera for that matter is fine. If you don't have access to camera and are on campus, cameras are available for checkout in Gaylord.

## 5\. Build your technology toolkit

This is touched on heavily about in the syllabus. Go ahead and get Adobe Creative Cloud installed this week. You can also forgo the expense and use the Gaylord labs but it is recommended that you purchase a subscription, even if it's just for this semester.

## 6\. Participate in the Google Hangout ([link](https://plus.google.com/events/c2hmc5uv61fbq8p71ksskvfq4cs)) on Friday, Jan. 15 at 4pm.

Occasionally throughout the semester we will actually virtually come together. This will just be for me to give you some quick introductions where you actually see my face and mouth move. If you have been having in any complications with the technology, this will be a perfect time to iron out those details. BONUS: I'll also go over some Wordpress tricks here. If you can't attend due to a class conflict, let me know via email.

## 6\. Finally, take the quiz!

At the end of each unit you will take a quiz on D2L (learn.ou.edu) that is worth a total of 10 points. These exist as a mechanism for you to confirm that you have indeed completed each unit. It isn't actually a "quiz" in the traditional sense of the term. Rather, it's where you tell me that you have indeed completed each portion of the lesson by marking "True" (meaning you did it) or "False" (meaning that you did not do it). Please note: This class, like all the classes at OU, is governed by an Honor Code, which means you must be honest and accurate in the work you do. So, to make sure you are being honest and accurate, read each question differently.When you answer "true," you are taking responsibility for that answer. Wrongly saying you did it, when you indeed did not do it, is a violation of the Honor Code, subject to penalties listed in the **[OU Guide to Academic Integrity](http://onlinecourselady.pbworks.com/w/page/83632159/honorcodeviolations).**
