<h1>Analyzing atonal music</h1>

<p>Following are a few tips, terms, and common structures that will be helpful for analyzing early twentieth-century atonal music, such as that composed by members of the Second Viennese School (Schönberg, Berg, Webern).</p>

<h1>Intervals</h1>

<p>Always use <em>chromatic intervals</em> rather than diatonic intervals when analyzing and comparing pitch materials. (See <a href="Intervals.html">Intervals and dyads</a> resource.)</p>

<h1>The 12-pitch-class cycle — clock face</h1>

<p>Atonal composers often begin with highly organized set of pitch classes, and then deploy the pitch classes in a wide variety of registers. Thus, it is helpful to eliminate register as a factor in order to find which motives, chords, and fragments belong in the same category. To do so, take a clock face with the twelve pitch-classes (spelling does not matter)</p>

<p><img src="Graphics/postTonal/clockFace.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>and mark all the pitch classes involved in the fragment. For example, here is a C-major scale:</p>

<p><img src="Graphics/postTonal/clockFace-diatonic.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This will make it easy to find the interval patterns in a set of pitch classes, no matter how they are distributed in the various registers and instruments on the score.</p>

<h1>Common pitch-class collections</h1>

<p><strong>Diatonic</strong> – The usual major and <em>natural</em>-minor collections (white key collection and all of its transpositions).</p>

<p><img src="Graphics/postTonal/major.png" alt="" /><br/>
<img src="Graphics/postTonal/minor.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Pentatonic</strong> – The black key collection and all of its transpositions, prime form: (02479).</p>

<p><img src="Graphics/postTonal/pentatonicBlack.png" alt="" /><br/>
<img src="Graphics/postTonal/pentatonicWhite.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Octatonic</strong> – An eight-pitch-class scale that alternates i1 and i2 (semitones and whole-tones).</p>

<p><img src="Graphics/postTonal/octatonic.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Hexatonic</strong> – A six-pitch-class scale that alternates i1 and i3 (semitones and minor thirds/augmented seconds).</p>

<p><img src="Graphics/postTonal/hexatonic.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>X-cell</strong> – The chromatic tetrachord, or a four-pitch-class chromatic cluster, prime form: (0123).</p>

<p><img src="Graphics/postTonal/xCell.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Y-cell</strong> – The whole-tone tetrachord, or a four-pitch-class whole-tone cluster, prime form: (0246). It is a subset of the whole-tone scale.</p>

<p><img src="Graphics/postTonal/yCell.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Z-cell</strong> – A four-pitch-class collection that alternates i1 and i5 (semitones and perfect fourths), prime form: (0167). Two Z-cells a minor third apart form an octatonic scale.</p>

<p><img src="Graphics/postTonal/zCell.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>French-sixth</strong> – The usual french-augmented-sixth-chord collection, but stripped of its tonal function, prime form: (0268). It is a subset of the whole-tone collection and octatonic collections. Like the Z-cell, two French-sixth chords a minor third apart form an octatonic scale.</p>

<p><img src="Graphics/postTonal/frenchSixth.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Whole-tone scale</strong> – A six-pitch-class scale made up of successive whole tones, prime form: (02468T).</p>

<p><img src="Graphics/postTonal/wholeTone.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Acoustic scale</strong> – A seven-pitch-class scale that resembles the major scale, but with <em>fa</em> raised to <em>fi</em> and <em>ti</em> lowered to <em>te</em>, in order to match the seventh and eleventh partials of the natural harmonic series.</p>

<p><img src="Graphics/postTonal/acoustic.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Dual-diatonic</strong> – An eight-pitch-class scale formed by the union of two diatonic collections separated by fifth—for example C major and G major: C – D – E – F – F# – G – A – B. It contains two diatonic scales, two Z-cells, and two Y-cells. It was used primarily by Bartók.</p>

<h1>Common <em>operations</em></h1>

<h3>Transposition</h3>

<p>Pitch transposition involves moving every pitch in a collection up or down by a specified interval.</p>

<p>Pitch-class transposition does the same thing. However, because of the cyclical nature of pitch classes, PC-transposition also corresponds to <em>rotation</em> of a collection of pitch classes around a clock face.</p>

<p>Transposition operations can be denoted by a capital "T" followed by a subscript indicating the number of semitones of the transposition. For pitch-class transpositions, use ordered pitch-class intervals (numbers 0–11). Transposing a collection or fragment up a whole step is labeled <strong>T<sub>2</sub></strong>; up a tritone is <strong>T<sub>6</sub></strong>, down a semitone is <strong>T<sub>11</sub></strong> (mod12(–1) = 11).</p>

<h3>Inversion</h3>

<p><em>Melodic inversion</em> occurs when all ascending melodic intervals in a melody are replaced with descending intervals of the same size, and all descending replaced with ascending of the same size. The following melodies are inversion of each other.</p>

<p><img src="Graphics/postTonal/melodyUp.png" alt="" /><br/>
<img src="Graphics/postTonal/melodyDown.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Pitch inversion</em> occurs when all pitches are inverted, or flipped, around an axis of symmetry in pitch space (in other words, the axis of symmetry is a pitch). In the above melodic example, the axis is G4. Since the first pitch is G4, it remains unchanged. The next pitch (A4) is two semitones above G4; it is replaced with F4, two semitones below G4. B4 (i4 above G4) is replaced by E-flat4 (i4 below G4). And so on.</p>

<p>Pitch inversion can apply to a melody, but also to a simultaneity, or to a collection that a passage is based on.</p>

<p>In general, when two melodies, simultaneities, or collections can be related by pitch inversion, they are considered to be equivalent in some sense (but, obviously, not identical).</p>

<p><em>Pitch-class inversion</em> occurs when all pitch classes of a collection are inverted, or flipped, around an axis of symmetry in pitch-class space (in other words, the axis of symmetry is a pitch class). Since pitch-class space is cyclical (once you go up 12 semitones, you are back where you started), the axis of symmetry is comprised of <em>two</em> pitch classes a tritone apart. This is most clearly seen on a clock face.</p>

<p><img src="Graphics/postTonal/clockFace-tetraChord.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When the above set is inverted around the axis C/F-sharp, it becomes the following set:</p>

<p><img src="Graphics/postTonal/clockFace-tetraChordInverted.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When pitch classes are labeled by number (C = 0, C-sharp = 1, . . . B = 11), pitch class inversion can be calculated by determining a <em>sum</em> and finding the difference between that sum and each pitch class in the original collection. The difference is the pitch class for the new collection.</p>

<p>In the above example, the set {C, D, E, F} is {0, 2, 4, 5}. Its inversion {G, G-sharp, B-flat, C} is {7, 8, 10, 0}. When inverting the original around the C/F-sharp axis, C becomes C (0 becomes 0), D–B-flat (2–10), E–G-sharp (4–8), and F–G (5–7). All of these pitch-class pairs add to 0 or 12, which are equivalent modulo12. Thus the inversion sum is 0, and the inversion is labeled <strong>I<sub>0</sub></strong>.</p>

<p>Inverting about the C-sharp/G axis is <strong>I<sub>2</sub></strong>. Inverting about the D/G-sharp axis is <strong>I<sub>4</sub></strong>. Inverting about the E-flat/A axis is <strong>I<sub>6</sub></strong>. Inverting about the E/B-flat axis is <strong>I<sub>8</sub></strong>. Inverting about the F/B axis is <strong>I<sub>10</sub></strong>. Odd number sums will place the axis between pitch classes (<strong>I<sub>1</sub></strong> between C/C-sharp and F-sharp/G, fox example).</p>

<p>Some atonal composers like to make use of sets that invert and/or transpose onto themselves. Sets that can be inverted around an axis of symmetry without changing any pitch classes are called <em>inversionally symmetrical</em>. Sets that can be transposed a certain interval without changing any of its pitch classes are called <em>transpositionally symmetrical</em> or <em>rotationally symmetrical</em>. The Z-cell and French-Sixth collections are sets that are both rotationally and inversionally symmetrical.</p>
