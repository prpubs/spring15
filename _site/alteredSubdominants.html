<h1>Chromatically altered subdominant chords</h1>

<p>The most common chromatically altered subdominant chords (aside from the applied dominant of V) are the <em>Neapolitan chord</em> and the various <em>augmented-sixth chords</em>.</p>

<p><img src="Graphics/N-AugSixths.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2>Neapolitan chord</h2>

<p>The Neapolitan chord contains lowered scale-degree 2, along with scale-degree 4, and lowered scale-degree 6: <em>ra</em>, <em>fa</em>, and <em>le</em>. It is a major triad, and it usually appears with <em>fa</em> in the bass (first-inversion), which is also doubled in a four-voice texture. It's designation is <strong>N6</strong>.</p>

<p>In a Roman numeral analysis, <strong>N6</strong> substitutes for a Roman numeral (that is, it is not a flat-II chord). In a functional bass analysis, <strong>N</strong>. is placed below the functional designation of <strong>[S4]</strong>.</p>

<h2>Augmented-sixth chords</h2>

<p>Augmented-sixth chords are so named because of the augmented sixth that occurs between <em>le</em> and <em>fi</em>, the two scale-degrees that are present in every augmented-sixth chord. The other pitch(es) in the chord determine which kind of augmented-sixth chord is present.</p>

<p>The <em>Italian augmented-sixth chord</em> is the simplest augmented-sixth chord, with only three members: <em>le</em>, <em>do</em>, and <em>fi</em>. <em>Le</em> is typically the bass note, and in a four-voice texture, <em>do</em> is typically the pitch that is doubled. When <em>le</em> occurs in the bass, the functional designation is <strong>[S6]</strong>. Under that functional bass symbol, we also label the chord <strong>It.</strong> In a Roman numeral analysis, just <strong>It.</strong> will do. The figured bass is a simple slashed "6."</p>

<p>The <em>French augmented-sixth chord</em> has four members: <em>le</em>, <em>do</em>, <em>re</em>, and <em>fi</em>. As in the Italian sixth, <em>le</em> is typically the bass note, and the functional designation is <strong>[S6]</strong>. Under that functional bass symbol, we label the chord <strong>Fr.</strong> In a Roman numeral analysis, just <strong>Fr.</strong> will do. The figured bass is a slashed "6" with a "4" and a "3."</p>

<p>The <em>German augmented-sixth chord</em> has four members: <em>le</em>, <em>do</em>, <em>me</em>, and <em>fi</em>. As in the other augmented sixth chords, <em>le</em> is typically the bass note, and the functional designation is <strong>[S6]</strong>. Under that functional bass symbol, we label the chord <strong>Ger.</strong> In a Roman numeral analysis, just <strong>Ger.</strong> will do. The figured bass is a slashed "6" with a "5." The German sixth is almost always followed by a cadential 6/4 chord.</p>

<p>The <em>Swiss augmented-sixth chord</em> has four members: <em>le</em>, <em>do</em>, <em>ri</em>, and <em>fi</em>. This chord is named "Swiss" because it sounds German but is spelled like the French. (<em>ri</em> in place of <em>me</em>) (Switzerland is a mixture of German-, French-, Italian-, and Romansch-based languages and cultures, with German and French being the largest.) <em>Le</em> is typically the bass note, and the functional designation is <strong>[S6]</strong>. Under that functional bass symbol, we label the chord <strong>Sw.</strong> In a Roman numeral analysis, just <strong>Sw.</strong> will do. The figured bass is a slashed "6" with a slashed "4" and a "3."</p>
